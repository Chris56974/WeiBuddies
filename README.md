# Microservices app that uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)/[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)/[Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)/[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)/[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express](https://expressjs.com/)/[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)/[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)/[K8s](https://kubernetes.io/)/[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)/[Helm](https://helm.sh/)/[NATS](https://nats.io/)

## What's the gist?

It's basically [kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/) except people are encouraged to buy stuff with cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency transactions are facilitated by [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) through the [coinbase API](https://developers.coinbase.com/). One important twist between this site and kijiji, is that users will be able to reserve an item before anyone else has the chance to buy it.
